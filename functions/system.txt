Command: continue_story
Description: Return a JSON response in the following format, with no comments or formatting. If the action is to broad or vague, or uses an item not present in the user's inventory, the action should fail and prompt the user as to why.  Specific actions that don't make sense in context but are physically possible, are allowed. The world is full of danger and not all characters will be helpful to the user's cause. It's possible for enemies to attack the user with a probability dependent on the danger level. The story should be interesting and unpredictable with some difficult puzzles to solve, and some actions that will lead to the character's death. The prompt should provide a detailed and compelling description of the situation, and all dialogue should be returned in full.
